# Real-Time Signal Processing in Faust Towards Applications for Hearing Impaired Workshop

## Description

**Dates:** October 3-7, 2022

**Instructors:** Romain Michon and Stefania Serafin

This five days workshop provides an introduction to real-time audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP) in the Faust programming language (<https://faust.grame.fr>) with a strong focus on techniques used in the context of hearing aids, cochlear implants, sound localization, etc. Students are walked through the semantic of Faust. A wide range of algorithms are covered and implemented (i.e., oscillators, filters, basic audio effects, etc.). Various tutorials demonstrating how Faust programs can be exported/integrated to a various platforms (i.e., audio plug-ins, smartphones, embedded systems, etc.) are given too. The last two days of the workshop are dedicated to final projects which can focus on a wide range of topics (e.g., hearing aids, cochlear implants simulation, etc.). The workshop culminates in a final presentation which will take place at the end of the morning of the last day of the workshop.

## Schedule

### Monday: Blips and Bloops

* Introduction to the Faust programming language
* Working with the Faust toolchain
* Simple sound generators (i.e., oscillators, AM, FM, etc.)
* Simple audio processors/effects (i.e., panning, tremolo, ring modulation, etc.)

### Tuesday: Filtering

* Basic FIR filters (i.e., one zero, comb, peak equalizers, etc.)
* Basic IIR filters (i.e., one pole, butter-worth, feedback comb, biquads, resonant filters, etc.)

### Wednesday: Making Actual Things

* Generating ready-to-use applications, plug-ins, etc. with Faust.
* Integrating Faust objects to existing/broader projects (e.g., JUCE plugins, smartphone apps, etc.).
* Brainstorm on final projects.
* Overview of signal processing techniques for hearing impaired applications.
* Advanced Faust coding techniques.

### Thursday: Working on Projects

* Final tour of projects
* Working on projects

### Friday: Working on Projects + Final Presentations

* Working on projects
* Final presentations
