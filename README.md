* Basic IIR filters (i.e., one pole, feedback comb, biquads, resonant filters, etc.)

### Wednesday: Making Actual Things

* Generating ready-to-use applications, plug-ins, etc. with Faust.
* Integrating Faust objects to existing/broader projects (e.g., JUCE plugins, smartphone apps, etc.).
* Brainstorm on final projects.
* Overview of signal processing techniques for hearing impaired applications.
* Advanced Faust coding techniques.
